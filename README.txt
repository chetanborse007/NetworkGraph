I. INTRODUCTION
---------------

This is a network graph utility, which represents data communication network consisting Routers as vertices and Links as edges.

This utility represent network that follows the OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) protocol for routing packets using Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm. The criteria used to compute the weight corresponding to a link includes the time taken for data transmission.
The shortest path algorithm in the utility computes the best path using the criterion of minimizing the total time taken for data to reach the destination. Here, the shortest time path minimizes the sum of the transmission times of the links along the path.This utility also handles network topology that changes dynamically based on the state of the links and the routers.
For example, a link may go down, router may crash, a new link is added or removed.

This utility has below major functionalities:
1. Find shortest path for routing data packets
2. Find reachable routers

3. Mac OS or Linux (Not tested on Windows)


IV. INSTALLATION
----------------

A. MAC OS:
    1. Download `NetworkGraph.zip`

    2. Uncompress `NetworkGraph.zip`
        $ unzip NetworkGraph.zip

    3. Create build directory anywhere you want
        $ mkdir build

    4. Change to build directory
        $ cd build

    5. Generate Makefile
        $ cmake <Source Directory>
        e.g. $ cmake ../NetworkGraph/

    6. Build source
        $ make

    7. Find `./NetworkGraph` utility within build directory itself

B. Algorithms:
    1. Find shortest path for routing data packets:
	> Reset all routers.
	> Set SourceRouter's TimeToReach to 0.
	> Initialise Min Heap data structure with all the available routers.
	> If Min Heap is not empty,
		a. Extract Router from Min Heap, which has minimal time to reach.
		b. If extracted router is down,
		   Then,
			Do not consider the extracted router.
		c. For every outgoing link,
			- If outgoing link is down,
		   	  Then,
				Do not consider the outgoing link.
			- If the shortest distance is found,
			  Then,
				Update relevant adjacent router.
	> If Min Heap is empty,
	  Then,
		Stop algorithm.

    2. Find Reachable Routers:
	Note:
		Time Complexity = O(V + E*A),
		Where,
			V: Total routers in a network
			E: Total links in a network
			A: Total ancestors for every router in a network
		If A~V, Time Complexity = O(V + E*V).

	> Reset all routers.
	> Transpose Network Graph.
	> For every router,
		a. If router is down,
		   Then,
			Do not consider it.
		c. For every outgoing link,
			- If outgoing link is down,
		   	  Then,
				Do not consider the outgoing link.
